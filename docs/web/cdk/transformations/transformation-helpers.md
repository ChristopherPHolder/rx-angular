## Overview

Transformation helpers provide a set of performance optimized tools that simplifies the management of data structures in an immutable way.

Currently, transformation helpers support the management of objects and arrays.

You can use the transformation helpers without RxAngular packages but expect the behavior to be opinionated since, in the first place, this package is designed to optimize state management with RxAngular.
